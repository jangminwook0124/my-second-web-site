      <strong>WEB</strong>
        The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web,<br>
        a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser.<br>
        Many people assume that the Web is the same as the Internet, and use these terms interchangeably.<br>
        However, the term Internet actually refers to the global network of servers that makes the information<br>
        sharing that happens over the Web possible. So, although the Web does make up a large portion of the Internet,<br>
        but they are not one and same.<br>
